## A solid startingpoint without the bloat.

Pavilion is a CSS framework for developers who tend to never use the hundreds of pre-made UI components other CSS frameworks ship with. Pre-made UI elements never really suit your needs and you’ll end up customizing them anyway. Therefore Pavilion only ships with basic, common components. The rest is up to you.

Written in SCSS, Pavilion lays down the groundwork with tried and tested core settings for accesability, readability and responsiveness. It includes an easy to understand grid system to create the layouts you need. Basic components like buttons, lists, forms and tables have appealing yet minimal styling.

All of Pavilion’s CSS properties and settings — may it be for typography or for breakpoints — are derived from its core `variables.scss` file. This makes customizing Pavilion a walk in the park — not an annoying CSS puzzle.
