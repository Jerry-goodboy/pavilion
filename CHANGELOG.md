v1.0.25
=======================================================
(june 17 2016)

In this version, the first significant patches were made.

- All attribute css selectors were replaced by class selectors. The following files were affected:
    - _grid.scss
    - _forms.scss
    - _flexbox.scss
    
    The changes for the user include adding an extra class to form elements for inline radio & checkboxes. 
    Also the input with a button now has an extra class.
